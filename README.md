# Panorama Tab Groups

Panorama Tab Groups is an easy way to organize a lot of tabs. You can visually group related tabs and switch between groups. 

Panorama Tab Groups is an updated and maintained fork of [Panorama View](https://github.com/photodiode/panorama-view) which is an implementation of the old [Panorama/Tab Groups add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-groups-panorama/) which was deprecated with the new Firefox web extension system.

## Installation

Panorama Tab Groups is available as a Firefox Add-on [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/panorama-tab-groups/). Just follow the link, click "Add to Firefox", and you're good to go.

## Usage

The default shortcut to switch to panorama view is Ctrl+Shift+F and you can to the next or previous tab group with Alt+W/Alt+Shift+W.

And of these shortcuts can be changed in the add-on preferences tab.

## To Do
 1. Close tab group when empty
 1. Assign names to groups by default
 1. Add ability to create groups with your mouse
 1. Newly created groups are created in an open space and not in the left corner
 1. Better grouping for pinned tabs
